# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps cluster administrators diagnose common issues with the AMD GPU DRA driver and provides guidance for reporting problems.

## Quick diagnostic commands

Run these commands first when something isn't working:

```bash
# Check driver pod status
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -l app.kubernetes.io/name=k8s-gpu-dra-driver

# Check driver pod logs
kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod> -c plugin

# Check init container logs (if pod is stuck initializing)
kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod> -c driver-init

# List ResourceSlices published by the driver
kubectl get resourceslices -o wide

# Inspect a specific ResourceSlice's attributes and capacities
kubectl get resourceslice <name> -o yaml

# Check ResourceClaim allocation status
kubectl get resourceclaim <name> -o yaml

# Check pod events for scheduling or claim errors
kubectl describe pod <name>
```

## Common issues

### Driver pod stuck in Init state

**Symptom:** Pod shows `Init:0/1` and the init container keeps restarting.

**Cause:** The `amdgpu` kernel module is not loaded on the node. The init container waits for `/sys/class/kfd` and `/sys/module/amdgpu/drivers/` to appear before allowing the driver to start.

**Resolution:**
1. Check if the kernel driver is loaded: `lsmod | grep amdgpu`
2. If missing, install the ROCm or `amdgpu-dkms` package for your distribution.
3. Verify the devices appear: `ls /sys/class/kfd/kfd/topology/nodes/`

### No ResourceSlices appearing

**Symptom:** `kubectl get resourceslices` returns no entries for a node where GPUs are expected.

**Cause:** The driver cannot discover GPUs via sysfs.

**Resolution:**
1. Check the driver pod logs for discovery errors: `kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod> -c plugin`
2. Verify GPU hardware is visible on the node: `ls /sys/class/kfd/kfd/topology/nodes/`
3. Ensure the DaemonSet is scheduled to the correct nodes — check `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` in your Helm values.

### Expected attributes missing from ResourceSlices

**Symptom:** A CEL selector referencing an attribute fails, or an attribute you expect (based on documentation or examples) is absent from the ResourceSlice YAML.

**Cause:** The driver reads device attributes from sysfs at discovery time. If sysfs does not expose a particular attribute for your GPU model, it will not appear in the ResourceSlice. Documentation and examples may reference attributes that are not available on all hardware.

**Resolution:**
1. Inspect the ResourceSlice to see which attributes are actually published for your hardware:
   ```bash
   kubectl get resourceslice <name> -o yaml
   ```
2. Adjust your CEL selectors to reference only attributes that are present.
3. Check driver logs for `VRAM info not available ... reporting 0`. The corresponding ResourceSlice keeps the `memory` capacity key with a value of zero. This indicates that VRAM discovery failed; it does not mean that the GPU physically has no memory.

### ResourceClaim stuck Pending

**Symptom:** A ResourceClaim stays in Pending state and the pod referencing it is also Pending.

**Cause:** No available device matches the claim's CEL selector, or no ResourceSlices exist.

**Resolution:**
1. Verify ResourceSlices are published (see diagnostic commands above).
2. Compare the claim's CEL selector against actual device attributes in the ResourceSlice.
3. Common mistakes:
   - Referencing attributes not available on the hardware (see "Expected attributes missing" above).
   - Using wrong attribute names or values.
   - Requesting more GPUs than are available on any single node.

### Pod stuck Pending after ResourceClaim is allocated

**Symptom:** The ResourceClaim shows as allocated, but the pod remains Pending or fails to start.

**Cause:** Possible issues with CDI spec generation, kubelet plugin communication, or device preparation.

**Resolution:**
1. Check the driver pod logs for errors during device preparation:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod> -c plugin | grep -i "prepare\|error"
   ```
2. Verify CDI specs are being written to the configured path (default: `/var/run/cdi`).
3. Check kubelet logs on the node for DRA-related errors.

### Container fails with `unresolvable CDI devices` after a driver restart or node reboot

**Symptom:** `kubectl describe pod` shows `CreateContainerError` with `CDI device injection failed: unresolvable CDI devices k8s.gpu.amd.com/gpu=<claim-uid>-...`, while the ResourceClaim still reports `allocated,reserved`.

**Cause:** The claim's CDI spec under the CDI path (default `/var/run/cdi`, usually tmpfs) is gone, while the driver's checkpoint still lists the claim as prepared. The kubelet does not prepare an already-prepared claim again while it keeps running, so nothing rewrites the spec until the driver starts.

**Resolution:**
1. Restart the driver pod on the node. On startup the driver rebuilds the spec of every checkpointed claim whose device nodes still match the host and logs `Rebuilt the CDI spec for checkpointed claim <claim-uid>`.
2. If the log instead shows `Removing the CDI spec for claim <claim-uid>, whose checkpoint entry can no longer be rebuilt`, the device nodes changed since the claim was prepared (for example a reboot renumbered `/dev/dri`). Delete and recreate the pod so the claim is prepared again; a `NodePrepareResources` error for the claim that says `recreate the pod` points at the same action.
3. If the log shows `Leaving the CDI spec for claim <claim-uid> as is`, discovery did not find the claim's device on this start. Check the discovery errors earlier in the log.

### Partition-related issues

**Symptom:** Partition devices do not appear in ResourceSlices, or partition claims remain Pending.

**Cause:** GPUs must be pre-partitioned before the driver can discover them. The driver does not dynamically create or modify GPU partitions.

**Resolution:**
1. Verify GPUs are partitioned: `amd-smi partition --list`
2. Partition GPUs before deploying the driver. See the [AMD GPU Operator partitioning guide](https://instinct.docs.amd.com/projects/gpu-operator/en/latest/dcm/applying-partition-profiles.html).
3. After partitioning, restart the driver pods to trigger re-discovery.
4. See the partition examples in [docs/demo.md](demo.md) for the expected setup.

## Known limitations

- **No dynamic GPU partitioning:** GPUs must be pre-partitioned before driver deployment. The driver discovers existing partitions but does not create, modify, or remove them.
- **Kubernetes 1.32+ required:** The DRA APIs used by this driver require Kubernetes 1.32 or later. The specific API version (`v1`, `v1beta2`, `v1beta1`) varies by Kubernetes version — the Helm chart auto-detects this.
- **Sysfs-dependent attributes:** Device attributes are read from sysfs at discovery time. Attributes not exposed by the kernel driver or hardware will not appear in ResourceSlices. Documentation and examples may reference attributes that are not available on all GPU models.
- **Unreadable VRAM:** When sysfs does not report a valid VRAM size, the driver publishes `memory: 0` and logs a warning. Memory-aware claims should require a positive capacity behind an existence guard (see the selector example in the driver attributes reference). Restart the driver after correcting the underlying sysfs/driver issue so discovery runs again.
- **Prepared claims do not survive a device renumbering:** Device names are built from DRM minors (`gpu-<card>-<render>`), which the kernel assigns dynamically. When a reboot, module reload, or repartition renumbers a device node, the driver refuses to prepare the claims recorded against the old numbers and logs that their checkpoint entries can no longer be rebuilt; recreate those pods so the scheduler allocates against the current devices. Unchanged numbers are not proof that a name still refers to the same physical GPU.

## Reporting issues

When opening a GitHub issue, include the following information to help us diagnose the problem quickly.

### Environment

- Kubernetes version: `kubectl version`
- Helm chart version: `helm list -n <namespace>`
- GPU model and count: `amd-smi list` or `lspci | grep AMD`
- Node OS and kernel version: `uname -a`
- AMD GPU kernel driver version: `modinfo amdgpu | grep ^version`

### Diagnostic output

- Driver pod logs: `kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod> -c plugin`
- ResourceSlice listing: `kubectl get resourceslices -o yaml`
- ResourceClaim status (if applicable): `kubectl get resourceclaim <name> -o yaml`
- Pod describe output (if applicable): `kubectl describe pod <name>`

## VFIO passthrough troubleshooting

### No VFIO devices in ResourceSlice

The `VFIOPassthrough` feature gate must be enabled:

```bash
--feature-gates=VFIOPassthrough=true
```

Verify with: `kubectl get resourceslices -o json | jq '.items[].spec.devices[].attributes["gpu.amd.com"].type'` — look for `vfio` entries.

### IOMMU not enabled

```bash
ls /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/
```

If empty or missing, IOMMU is not enabled. Add `amd_iommu=on` to the kernel
cmdline and reboot. Without IOMMU, the VFIO manager will not initialize.

### GIM driver not loaded (no VFs discovered)

```bash
lsmod | grep gim
ls /sys/bus/pci/drivers/gim/
```

GIM must be loaded for SR-IOV VF discovery. VFs appear as `virtfn*` symlinks
under the GIM-managed PF in sysfs.

### vfio_pci module not loaded

```bash
lsmod | grep vfio_pci
```

If not loaded: `modprobe vfio_pci`. The driver logs a warning at startup but
continues without it — pre-bound devices still work, but on-demand binding
will fail.

### Device stuck on vfio-pci after VM deletion

If `Unconfigure` fails during Unprepare, the device remains bound to `vfio-pci`.
Check the driver logs for errors:

```bash
kubectl logs <driver-pod> | grep -i "unconfigure\|unbind"
```

Manual recovery: unbind from vfio-pci and rebind to the original driver:

```bash
echo <pci-addr> > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/unbind
echo <pci-addr> > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/amdgpu/bind
```
